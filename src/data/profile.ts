  bio: `I build things for the web and explore the intersection of software and data.
Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science (Data Science) at KIT Kolhapur,
obsessed with clean code, great UX, and systems that scale.

When I'm not writing code, I'm experimenting with machine learning models,
building full-stack apps, or debugging something I broke at 2am.`,
